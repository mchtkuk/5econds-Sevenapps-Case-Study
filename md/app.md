SevenApps React Native Case Study
Video Diary App

Objective
Develop a React Native Video Diary App where users can:

• Import videos,
• Crop a specific segment of 5 seconds,
• Add details such as name and description,
• Save cropped videos to a list for future reference.

The app should prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, adhering to modern React Native development practices.
Case Study Requirements

Main Features

1. Main Screen: Cropped Video List
   • Display a list of previously cropped videos.
   • Implement persistent storage (e.g., Zustand with AsyncStorage or an alternative state management solution).
   • Allow users to tap a video in the list to navigate to the Details Page.

2. Details Page
   • Display the selected video with its:
   • Name,
   • Description.
   • Keep the UI minimalistic, focusing on the video and its associated metadata.

3. Crop Modal
   • Step 1: Video Selection
   • Allow users to select a video from their device.

• Step 2: Video Cropping
• Display the video with a scrubber allowing users to select the start and end points for a 5-second segment.
• Below the scrubber, include a button to proceed to the next step.

• Step 3: Add Metadata
• Include two input fields:
• Name (text input),
• Description (text area).
• Add a button to execute the cropping operation.

4. Video Cropping
   • Implement video cropping functionality using expo-trim-video.
   • The trimVideo function under expo-trim-video script should execute via Tanstack Query, ensuring asynchronous
   operations and a robust API integration.

Bonus Features

1. Edit Page (Optional)
   • Add a page allowing users to edit the Name and Description of a cropped video.
   • Include a form with two inputs:
   • Name
   • Description
   • Persist updates to storage.
2. Enhancements
   • Use Expo SQLite for storing and reading video data.
   • Integrate React Native Reanimated for smoother animations.
   • Use Zod or Yup for form input validation.

Required Technologies
• Core Technologies
• Expo: Base framework for React Native development.
• Expo Router: For implementing app navigation.
• Zustand: State management solution.
• Tanstack Query: To manage async logic and the expo-trim-video cropping process.
• expo-trim-video: Core library for video processing.
• NativeWind: Styling solution.
• Expo Video: Video rendering and playback (or any suitable alternative).
• Bonus Technologies
• Expo SQLite: For structured, persistent storage.
• React Native Reanimated: For animations.
• Zod/Yup: Validation schemas for form handling.

Key Considerations

1. Scalability
   • Ensure the app can handle a growing list of cropped videos efficiently.
   • Abstract key features into reusable components (e.g., VideoPlayer, MetadataForm).
2. Performance
   • Use efficient libraries like Tanstack Query to handle background processing.
3. Usability
   • Simplify navigation and UX design for intuitive user interactions.
   • Use NativeWind for clean and responsive styling.
4. Validation
   • Use Zod or Yup to validate user inputs for metadata (e.g., Name and Description).

Deliverables
• A functional React Native app with all specified features.
• Bonus features (if implemented) for enhanced functionality.
• Clean and modular codebase adhering to best practices.
• Documentation for setup and usage instructions.
